Use a Screenshot tool to make the screenshot (for example ShareX in Windows) of the page and use it in your videos, webpage or whatever.

TO-BE-DO-BE-DOO
- Currently only macOS keyboard is added.
- No screenshot saving mechanism
- need to make a quiz game on learning keyboard shortcuts from this

Feel free to suggest ideas
